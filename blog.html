            <p>JavaScript provides three main variable declarations: <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and
                <code>const</code>. These declarations differ not only in how they're used but also in their scope,
                which determines where the variable is accessible and how long it remains in memory.

            <h2 class="text-xl font-medium">The Scope of var:</h2>
            <p>The <code>var</code> keyword has function scope. This means that a variable declared with
                <code>var</code> is accessible within the function it's declared in, or globally if declared outside a
                function. This can sometimes lead to unintended behavior, like variable hoisting, where a variable
                declared with <code>var</code> is moved to the top of its scope during execution.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-medium">The Scope of let:</h2>
            <p>The <code>let</code> keyword was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) to address some of the issues with
                <code>var</code>. <code>let</code> has block scope, which means it's confined to the nearest block
                (e.g., inside a loop or conditional statement). This prevents unintended variable hoisting and allows
                for more predictable behavior.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-medium">The Scope of const:</h2>
            <p>Like <code>let</code>, <code>const</code> also has block scope. However, <code>const</code> variables
                cannot be reassigned after declaration. They are used for values that shouldn't change during the
                program's execution. While the value itself is immutable, it's important to note that objects and arrays
                declared with <code>const</code> can have their properties modified.</p>

            <h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Blog 2: Null vs Undefined in JavaScript</h1>
            <p>JavaScript, as a dynamically typed language, provides two special values to represent the absence of a
                meaningful value: <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code>. While they might seem similar, they have
                distinct use cases and behaviors in JavaScript.</p>

                alt="" class="w-[60%] mx-auto">
            <h2 class="text-xl font-medium">The Use Cases of <code>null</code></h2>
            <p><code>null</code> is a deliberate absence of any object value. It is often used when a variable should
                explicitly have no value or when you want to reset a variable's value to nothing.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Common use cases of <code>null</code> include:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ms-10">
                <li>Initializing a variable that is expected to hold an object later in the program.</li>
                <li>Resetting a variable or property to indicate no current value.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-medium">The Use Cases of <code>undefined</code></h2>
            <p><code>undefined</code> represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It
                can also occur as the default return value of a function that doesn't explicitly return anything.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Common use cases of <code>undefined</code> include:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ms-10">
                <li>When a variable is declared but not initialized, it will have the value <code>undefined</code>.</li>
                <li>As the default value of function parameters that haven't been provided when calling the function.
                </li>
                <li>When accessing an object property that doesn't exist.</li>
            </ul>
